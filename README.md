# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Bounties
1). To Infura and Beyond:
• README should detail what the project is, what it aims to accomplish, and proof of what Consensys products you used
-> What the project is:
We have developed a product that utilizes blockchain technology to store product reviews and generative AI to extract meaningful information from those reviews. This allows the customers to access helpful information about a product before making a purchase, helping them make informed decisions.

-> What it aims to accomplish:
Customers find it difficult to get proper product reviews in offline stores instantly. They rely on the information provided by staff or need to search on the net manually. This is a bad user experience. Moreover, irrespective of the medium online or offline, they don't want to waste time reading hundreds of reviews and making some sense of it. Lastly, they also have trust issues regarding the authenticity of the reviews present on the product. Our solution aims to solve all these problems.
